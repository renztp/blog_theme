                    <p>C++ is one of the most popular programming languages. It is based on C but is an object-oriented programming language. It is widely used in graphics libraries, games, network devices, etc.</p>

                    <h4>Features of C++</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C++ is fast</li>
                        <li>Easy to learn</li>
                        <li>A powerful Progrmaming language</li>
                        <li>Has many built-in functions and operators which can make complex programs easy</li> 
                        <li>Can be compiled on a number of computer platforms</li>
                        <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language.</li>
                        <li>Use of pointer makes it a much more powerful language.</li>
                        <li>Also largely used in many large-scale projects</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>How to start?</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In this whole C++ tutorial, you will be learning about writing C++ programs. But what after that?

                        After writing any program, we need to compile and run it to see the output of the program.

                        So, what is meant by compiling ?

                    When we write our program in C++ language, it needs to be converted to machine language (which is binary language consisting of 0s and 1s) so that computer can understand and execute it. This conversion is known as compiling a program. We compile a code with the help of a compiler.</p>
